This page exists to help collate together R resources for the NUMBATs
group, to direct students to places to learn more about specific R
content. It is not intended as a replacement for courses, but instead a
place where people can go to learn more.

The core principles for the resources on this page are:

  - Content should be fresh and relevant, rooted in practical example,
    “why should we care”
  - The way these resources are distributed should be:
      - Accessible, reproducible, extendible
  - Links shared must work

# Current areas covered

The current areas covered are:

  - shiny
  - Reporting problems with your code
  - Debugging in R
